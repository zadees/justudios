&lt;h3&gt;Why I Like Flutter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter is made for developing 2D web apps quickly and does it well. It's very easy to get setup and at is easy to start building your first app. Without having to install any dependencies outside of what the basic flutter project gives you, we were able to create a pretty functional POC (Proof of Concept) that performed really well on both Android and IOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also liked that if you were looking for help in a topic, even an outdated version of Flutter's code was helpful and didn't send you trying to find exact versions of the platform.  This is something I have experienced with React Native as-well-as Angular development in general. So, I am glad to see that they are making good positive changes without breaking everything between iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Material Design just makes things simple.  This isn't going to be for everyone. I can fully understand if you want your app to be 100% customized by you without any input from someone else. But, Material Design is so customizable that it doesn't just feel like another Google App with paint on it. You can literally make your app look just about any way you want without having to worry about coding all of your widgets from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come from a background of PHP, a tiny bit of C#, JavaScript, Angular, and React.  Working with Dart seemed as though it was going to be a challenge.  I have limited experience with C#, but after working on this project it seems that having a small amount of exposure to C# and React really gives me the right mindset when working with the Dart language.  Working with React gave me exposure to the concept of Widgets and State Management, while working with C# helped me understand the way types and classes are being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm no expert at flutter yet, but I hope to become one one day. I think that this will gain traction and be a very great addition to companies who need to build mobile apps that are mostly CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) forms. So far, I like how it makes designing on Android and IOS easy, it provides me and my client the necessary tools to complete their job, and it is fun to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is Flutter The Best Way To Build An App?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are a range of ways to build an app, but I do think for a specific use case flutter can definitely be the best way to build an app.  You'll have to decide if it is best for your project on your own because each project can be a good fit with different technology. Where I see it being extremely valuable is if you need an app for both Android and IOS devices and you want to build it quickly without having to worry about maintaining a UI Library.  Having Material Design built in and theming options available, makes it really quick and easy to get an app looking like your own and still not having to custom build every widget.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Justin Flowers</name></author><summary type="html">I have been tasked with building alongside another developer a mobile app. This is not my first mobile app, but it is the first app that I have worked on that uses Flutter.

Why do I prefer it over other languages?  The main reason is that you can do just about anything with Javascript.  With one simple language you can spin up a server, write APIs, and write a user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Javascript is easy to learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javascript is easy to learn, at least the basics. Yes, there is a barrier to entry when you start talking about Angular, Typescript, React, etc... but if you want to just build stuff with Javascript you can. You only need a text editor to get started.  Once you learn the basics, you can then start learning something more specialized like React or Angular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Javascript is versatile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javascript can be full stack, meaning that it can be the language used to create your APIs as-well-as your front end code. I like the idea of having a single developer being able to easily work with the back end code as-well-as the front end code. This is easier to do when the language used on both the UI (User Interface) and the API (Application Programming Interface) is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even do styling with Javascript. This isn't always the best use of Javascript, but styling in Javascript can be very powerful when building components in React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Mobile! Mobile apps can be built with Javascript now.  Sure, you might get to a point where you'll need a little more than just Javascript but you can get pretty far with React Native or Phone Gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build desktop apps. With electron, you can build desktop apps with Javascript. VSCode, Microsofts free editor, uses the Electron framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Javascript has a ton of tutorials, packages, and documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is both a blessing and a curse. The great news is that there is a ton of information about Javascript on the internet. It's easy to find tutorials and documentation on just about anything you can think of. The issue with that? Some times it can be hard to find things that are up to date or packages that are still being maintained. There's a lot of garbage mixed in with the good content, but overall I'd still say this is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Justin Flowers</name></author><summary type="html">A lot of people have asked me what language I prefer to code in, and for now my answer is Javascript.

&lt;p&gt;I love working with people on web projects and helping them grow their business. One of the simplest things to do is to have a website where people can learn about your business. You may think that you took care of that back in 1999, but what good is a website if people can't find it, the information isn't up to date, or a user can't browse your site on their mobile phone. My goal is to make the web a better place, 1 site at a time. If you need someone to update your website, make your website look great on all devices, or even help getting your company found on Google than you have come to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Updating Website Content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making Mobile Friendly, Tablet and Phone, Versions Of Websites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing &amp; Implementing SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Strategies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating Analytic Reporting and Visitor Insight&lt;/li&gt;
