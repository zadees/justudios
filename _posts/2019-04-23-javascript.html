<p>A lot of people have asked me what language I prefer to code in, and for now my answer is Javascript. Why do I prefer it over other languages?  The main reason is that you can do just about anything with Javascript.  With one simple language you can spin up a server, write APIs, and write a user interface.</p>
<h3>Javascript is easy to learn</h3>>
<p>Javascript is easy to learn, at least the basics. Yes, there is a barrier to entry when you start talking about Angular, Typescript, React, etc... but if you want to just build stuff with Javascript you can. You only need a text editor to get started.  Once you learn the basics, you can then start learning something more specialized like React or Angular.</p>
<h3>Javascript is versatile</h3>
<p>Javascript can be full stack, meaning that it can be the language used to create your APIs as-well-as your front end code. I like the idea of having a single developer being able to easily work with the back end code as-well-as the front end code. This is easier to do when the language used on both the UI (User Interface) and the API (Application Programming Interface) is the same.</p>
<p>You can even do styling with Javascript. This isn't always the best use of Javascript, but styling in Javascript can be very powerful when building components in React.</p>
<p>Go Mobile! Mobile apps can be built with Javascript now.  Sure, you might get to a point where you'll need a little more than just Javascript but you can get pretty far with React Native or Phone Gap.</p>
<p>Build desktop apps. With electron, you can build desktop apps with Javascript. VSCode, Microsofts free editor, uses the Electron framework.</p>
<h3>Javascript has a ton of tutorials, packages, and documentation</h3>
<p>This is both a blessing and a curse. The great news is that there is a ton of information about Javascript on the internet. It's easy to find tutorials and documentation on just about anything you can think of. The issue with that? Some times it can be hard to find things that are up to date or packages that are still being maintained. There's a lot of garbage mixed in with the good content, but overall I'd still say this is a plus.</p>
